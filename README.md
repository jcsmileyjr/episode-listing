# COMPRESS.fm Episode Listing project based on the Advent of JS & CSS challenge, Day 5

### The Challenge
The challenge was to build a todo style list of the podcast's episodes that allow the user to:
1. Scratch on and off episodes that was listened to.
2. Include a "check all" box that checked all todos off

A future goal is to rebuild the project with TypeScript.
